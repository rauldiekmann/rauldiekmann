## Hi there 👋

<!--
<h1>Hi, I'm Raul</h1>
🖥️ I've been coding in Javascript primarily for 2 years
🦀 I’m learning Angular and .NET at the moment
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started studying to be a sysadmin because coding didn´t appeal to me, and in the coding subject of the course I found out it was my cup of tea 😁
